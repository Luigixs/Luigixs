# LuighyOliveira

Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio. 👋

I started studying Software Engineering and working with programming at the beginning of 2023. I already knew I liked it, but I wasn’t 100% sure about my interest in web development. Since then, I have continuously improved my skills and worked hard to develop high-performance, responsive applications. My focus is to keep evolving because I still have a lot of code ahead of me!

🚀 My Technical Skills:

✔️ 2 months of experience in front-end development with React.js and Next.js.
✔️ Advanced experience in HTML and CSS.
✔️ Knowledge of Tailwind CSS and Styled Components.
✔️ Experience with Git and GitHub.
✔️ Understanding of Clean Code principles.
✔️ Experience with Node.js.
✔️ Basic knowledge of MySQL databases.
